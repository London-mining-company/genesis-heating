# Genesis Heating Solutions: Business Plan (2026-2028)

## 1. Executive Summary
Genesis Heating Solutions is a specialized HVAC service provider based in London, Ontario. We leverage Superheat H1 technology to transform standard household electric water heating into an income-generating asset. By capturing waste heat from high-performance computing (Bitcoin mining), we provide homeowners with a "Net-Zero" heating path, zero technical friction, and local, white-glove support.

**Our Mission:** To turn wasted energy into community value through the "Neighbourhood Effect."

## 2. The Market Opportunity
### Location: London, Ontario
London is an ideal hub for this technology due to:
- **Increasing Utility Costs:** Residential electricity rates continue to climb, making utility-hedge technologies highly attractive.
- **Densely Populated Residential Hubs:** Ideal for concentrated "Neighborhood Pools" which optimize mining efficiency and service routes.
- **Homegrown Trust:** A market that values local expertise and professional, licensed HVAC installation over remote tech solutions.

## 3. The Value Proposition
### "Energy Recycling"
We don't just "mine Bitcoin"—we recycle heat. 
- **The Efficiency:** Computing generates 100% heat as a byproduct. We use that heat to warm water, effectively using 1 watt of power twice.
- **The "Hero" Factor:** We solve the two biggest hurdles to adoption—Upfront Cost and Technical Complexity—by offering a managed service that rewards loyalty.

## 4. Business Model: The Zero-Friction Path
We operate on a **Tiered Revenue Share Model** designed to maximize initial growth while ensuring long-term customer retention.

| Phase | Duration | Genesis Share | Customer Credit | Strategic Intent |
|-------|----------|---------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **I: Recovery** | 0-18 Mo | 75% | 25% | Rapidly recoup $4.5k installation/CAPEX cost. |
| **II: Balanced** | 19-36 Mo | 50% | 50% | Incentivize loyalty by doubling customer savings. |
| **III: Loyalty** | 37+ Mo | 35% | 65% | Residual income for Genesis; "Free Heating" for customer. |

**Zero Bitcoin Exposure:** Customers receive their credits in CAD (cash-only), while Genesis manages the underlying mining assets and pools.

## 5. Growth Strategy: The "Neighbourhood Effect"
We avoid generic "Network Effects" in favour of the **Neighbourhood Effect**. 
- **Local Consolidation:** By installing clusters of units within specific postal codes (e.g., Old North, Wortley Village), we create efficient service routes and localized mining pool incentives.
- **Referral Loops:** Neighbours who refer neighbours receive "Bonus Credits" that accelerate their transition to Phase II.
- **The Ethos:** Growing the hash-rate of the street increases the economic resilience of the community.

## 6. Marketing & Operations
### Grassroots Marketing
1. **Neighborhood Signage:** "This Home Recycles Waste Heat."
2. **Local SEO:** Targeted landing pages for London neighbourhoods.
3. **Consensus Workshops:** Small local seminars explaining the "Heat-to-Value" cycle.

### Lean Operations
- **Solo Management:** 1 person handles lead intake (automated via Airtable/Zapier), mining management, and scheduling.
- **Contracted Installation:** Partnering with licensed London HVAC techs on a per-job basis ($700/install).
- **Automated CRM:** Lead capture, follow-ups, and credit reporting are fully automated.

## 8. Risk Mitigation & Ethics
- **The "Little Guy" Guarantee:** We handle the complex pool management and hardware upkeep. If the unit doesn't earn, the customer still has hot water; Genesis takes the hardware risk.
- **Ethical Scaling:** As Bitcoin rewards halving events occur, Genesis adjusts management fees to ensure the homeowner's "utility hedge" remains intact first.
- **Privacy First:** Dedicated internet lines ensure homeowner data is never touched by the computing unit.

*This plan is designed for a single operator to achieve high-margin residual income through professional, local execution.*
