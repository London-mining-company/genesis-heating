# Genesis Heating Solutions: The "London Masterplan" (2026-2028)

## 1. Executive Summary
Genesis Heating Solutions is a high-growth HVAC technology provider in London, Ontario. We specialize in transforming standard utility costs into scalable income streams through energy recycling. By capturing the waste heat of high-performance computing (Superheat H1), we offer homeowners two distinct pathways to a net-zero heating future: total asset ownership or a zero-risk managed service.

## 2. The Core Innovation: Strategic Balancing
To ensure immediate cash flow while building long-term equity, we operate a dual-path engine:

### A. The Ownership Path (Cash Flow Fuel)
- **Target:** Commercial clients and high-intent homeowners.
- **Model:** $5,250 upfront purchase.
- **Economics:** Owners receive 85% rewards; Genesis retains 15% service fee.
- **Impact:** Upfront sales fund the CAPEX for the Managed Path portfolio.

### B. The Managed Path (Scalable Equity)
- **Target:** Mass-market homeowners.
- **Model:** $0 down + $250 Service Activation Fee.
- **Economics:** Tiered share (75% → 50% → 35% Genesis share).
- **Impact:** Genesis retains hardware ownership, building a high-yield infrastructure portfolio.

## 3. Growth: The Neighbourhood Effect
We reject generic scaling in favour of grassroots density. Our growth is built on localized community pools:
- **Concentrated Installs:** Clustered route density reduces contractor costs and optimizes mining pool performance.
- **Neighbourhood Pools:** Postal-code-based incentives that encourage neighbours to sign up together.
- **The Ethos:** Decentralized value generated on the street where it’s consumed.

## 4. Run-Rate Projections (Conservative)
*Assumes 1 Ownership Sale & 1 Managed Install per month.*

### Year 1: The Seed Phase
- **Monthly Revenue (Month 12):** ~$15,000+
- **Cumulative Profit:** $120,000+
- **Scaling:** Upfront profits from Title A sales cover the $4.5k/unit CAPEX for Title B.

### Year 2: The Infrastructure Phase
- **Portfolio Size:** 48+ Units
- **Monthly Residual:** ~$30,000+
- **Shift:** Recurring revenue from service fees and managing our own hardware begins to dwarf install labor.

---

## 5. Operations & Execution
- **Lean Management:** Single operator using advanced automation (Airtable / Zapier / Vercel).
- **Expert Delivery:** Partnership with licensed London HVAC chains for per-job professional installation.
- **Service Standards:** Every install is backed by a "Professional Service Agreement" to ensure hardware health and 24/7 hot water continuity.

## 6. Vision: The Grid-Scale Utility Hedge
By 2028, Genesis aims to be the primary provider of distributed thermal-computing in Southwestern Ontario, managing a decentralized fleet of units that offer both heat to the home and stable, CAD-based income to the family.
