## WHEN THEY ASK: "How much per month?"

**Answer:** 
> "Conservative estimate: $80-$150/month. On Package A, you'd get 85% of that immediately. On Package B, you start at 25% and grow to 65% by year three. I'd rather underpromise—the goal is utility offset, not get-rich-quick."

## OBJECTION SCRIPTS

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **"I need to think about it."** | "What specific part? Hardware, financials, or timeline?" |
| **"What if Bitcoin crashes?"** | "You still have hot water. The system heats water first. Credits are bonus." |
| **"Too good to be true?"** | "It's thermodynamics. Processors make heat. We just capture what would be wasted. We professionalize the complexity." |
| **"I can't afford it."** | "That's exactly why Package B exists. Zero upfront. Just $250 activation." |

## THE HIDDEN CLOSER: Neighbourhood Bonus

**Use If They Hesitate:**
> "We prioritize by neighbourhood density. If you and your neighbours sign up together, you move to the front of the line AND unlock a 5% community pool bonus. Know anyone on your street who'd be interested?"

**Why It Works:** Creates urgency + social proof + turns them into a referral source.
