- Genesis retains 15% service fee for pool management

**When to Present:**
- Business owners (tax write-off)
- High-income homeowners ($100k+)
- Cash-ready customers who want maximum control

**Pitch:**
> "You own the asset. We manage the technical side for a small fee. You receive the vast majority of the system's output from day one. This is for customers who value ownership and want the highest immediate return."

## 3. The Consultation Script (Residential)

### Opening (2 minutes)
"Thanks for taking the time. Before I explain how the Superheat H1 works, I want to understand your situation. What made you interested in this?"

**Listen for:**
- [ ] Utility cost concerns
- [ ] Environmental motivations
- [ ] Tech curiosity
- [ ] Budget constraints

### The Setup (3 minutes)
"Let me show you what this actually is. [Pull out spec sheet]

The Superheat H1 is a 2.0kW water heater that delivers 23 gallons per hour continuously—identical to your current electric tank. The difference is the processors inside. They perform high-value computing tasks, and the heat they generate warms your water.

It's the same watt of power doing two jobs: computation and heating."

**Pause. Let them ask questions.**

### The Value Reveal (5 minutes)
"Here's why people install this: your electric water heater is a pure cost. You pay for the electricity, you get hot water. Break even at best.

With the H1, that same energy consumption now produces a measurable utility offset. The system processes workloads 24/7. That work generates credits. Those credits reduce your effective heating cost.

How much you receive depends on the service agreement you select. We have two main paths..."

### Present the Packages (7 minutes)

**For High-Income/Business:**
"If you prefer ownership and want maximum immediate value, Package A makes sense. You purchase the unit upfront at $5,250. You own it. We manage the technical complexity for a 15% service fee, and you keep 85% of everything the system produces. This is the path for people who want asset ownership and the highest cash flow from day one."

**For Risk-Averse/Budget-Conscious:**
"If you'd rather not commit capital upfront, Package B is designed for that. You pay a $250 activation fee to cover the HVAC dispatch. We install the system at our cost. Your credits start immediately, and they grow over time.

Year 1: You receive 25% of the output.
Year 2: That grows to 50%.
Year 3 onward: You're at 65%.

We structure it this way because we carry the hardware risk. As the system proves itself to you, your share increases. By year three, you're receiving the majority—without ever having paid for the unit."

### Handle the Obvious Question: "How much per month?"
"That's the right question, and I'll be direct with you: it varies. The system earns based on compute demand and your local electricity rate. 

Conservative estimates put the monthly output somewhere between $80 and $150 per month for a typical London home. On Package A, you'd receive 85% of that immediately. On Package B, you start at 25% and grow to 65% over three years.

I'd rather underpromise. The goal isn't to make you rich—it's to offset your utility bill and hedge against rate increases. If Ontario Hydro raises rates 10%, your credits likely scale with that."

### The Close (3 minutes)
"Which path makes more sense for your situation?

If they hesitate: "Let me ask you this—if we could eliminate the upfront cost entirely, is this something you'd move forward with?"

If yes → Package B.
If no → "What's holding you back?"

**Objection Handling:**
- "I need to think about it." → "Absolutely. What specific part do you want to think through? The hardware, the financials, or the timeline?"
- "What if Bitcoin crashes?" → "You still have hot water. The system is a functional water heater first. Even if compute demand drops, the hardware heats your water exactly like your current tank. The credits are a bonus, not the core function."
- "Is this too good to be true?" → "Fair question. It's thermodynamics. The processors generate heat as a byproduct. We're just capturing something that would otherwise be wasted. The 'good' part is we're professionalizing it so you don't have to manage mining pools or hardware. We handle that."

## 4. The Neighbourhood Incentive (Hidden Closer)

**When to Use:** If they're on the fence.

"One more thing I should mention: we prioritize installations by neighbourhood density. If you and your neighbours sign up together, you move to the front of the line for Spring 2026 slots, and we unlock a 'community pool bonus'—an additional 5% share for your postal code.

Do you know anyone on your street who might be interested? We can do a quick neighbourhood intro session if that helps."

**Why This Works:**
- Creates urgency (queue position)
- Leverages social proof (neighbours are doing it)
- Turns them into a referral source before they even install

## 9. Honest Risks & How to Mitigate

### Risk: "What if compute demand crashes?"
**Reality:** The H1 still heats water. Customer isn't worse off than a standard tank.  
**Mitigation:** Frame it as "utility hedge," not "passive income machine."

### Risk: "What if we can't service all the demand?"
**Reality:** Good problem to have.  
**Mitigation:** Waitlist prioritization by neighbourhood. Manage expectations on install timing.

### Risk: "What if a customer's unit fails?"
**Reality:** Warranty covers hardware. Reputation hit if we don't respond fast.  
**Mitigation:** 48-hour service commitment. Maintain a backup unit for emergency swaps.
