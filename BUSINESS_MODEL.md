## Revenue Models (Flexible)

### Option A: The Ownership Path (Cash Flow Positive)
*Ideal for customers prioritized for immediate installation or business tax write-offs.*
```
Unit + Install Price:     $5,250 CAD (Upfront)
Installation Labor:        $700 CAD
Genesis Net Profit:      $1,175 CAD (Immediate)
Ongoing Service Fee:      15% of mining rewards (~$225/mo)
```
**Pros:** Instant cash flow, zero CAPEX risk, immediate profit.  
**Cons:** One-time initial profit, lower long-term residual vs managed path.

---

### Option B: The Managed Path (Tiered Subscription)
*Ideal for homeowners seeking a zero-risk utility hedge. Genesis carries the CAPEX to build long-term equity.*

**Service Activation Logic:**
- **Zero Down:** High adoption, Genesis builds hardware equity.
- **Service Activation Agreement:** Customers pay a small $250 activation fee to cover initial HVAC dispatch, improving Day 1 cash flow.

**Three-Phase Structure:**
| Phase | Duration | Genesis Share | Customer Credit |
|-------|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **I: Recovery** | 0-18 Mo | 75% | 25% |
| **II: Balanced** | 19-36 Mo | 50% | 50% |
| **III: Loyalty** | 37+ Mo | 35% | 65% |

**Why This Works:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Payback Period** | 4 months (Genesis recoups install cost) |
| **Customer 5-Year Value** | $37,500 in utility credits (vs. $0 with traditional water heater) |
| **Genesis 5-Year Revenue** | $47,250 per customer |
| **Genesis 5-Year Net Profit** | $42,750 per customer |
| **Customer ROI** | Infinite (paid $0, received $37,500 in credits) |

**Ethical Alignment:**
- Customer gets better deal over time (75%→65% of rewards)
- Genesis earns fair profit for genuine value (management, Bitcoin expertise, no-hassle service)
- After 3 years, customer is WAY ahead vs. DIY (no upfront cost, no technical headaches)
- Even at 35% Genesis share, customer still pays less than managing it themselves

**Scalability Example (24 units installed in Year 1):**
- Month 12: 12 units @ Phase 1 = $13,500/month revenue
- Month 24: 12 units @ Phase 2, 12 @ Phase 1 = $18,000/month revenue
- Month 36: 24 units @ Phase 2+ = $15,000+/month RESIDUAL income

**Pros:** Recurring income, rapid payback, scales to passive income, customers PREFER this (zero Bitcoin exposure)  
**Cons:** Requires upfront capital (mitigated by fast payback), must deliver excellent service to retain customers

## Year 1 Financials (Conservative: 2-4 installs/month)

### Monthly Costs
| Category | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| HVAC Contractor (2-4 jobs @ $700 each) | $1,400-2,800 |
| Marketing (Vercel, automations, ads) | $200 |

| **Total Monthly Costs** | **$1,850-3,250** |

### Revenue Scenarios

**Tiered Revenue Share Model (RECOMMENDED - 2 installs/month)**

**Months 1-4 (Cashflow Challenge):**
```
Month 1: 2 installs @ $4,500 cost = -$9,000 upfront
         2 units earning @ $1,125/unit = +$2,250 revenue
         Net: -$6,750

Month 2: 2 new installs = -$9,000
         4 units earning = +$4,500
         Net: -$4,500 (cumulative: -$11,250)

Month 3: 2 new installs = -$9,000
         6 units earning = +$6,750
         Net: -$2,250 (cumulative: -$13,500)

Month 4: 2 new installs = -$9,000
         8 units earning = +$9,000
         Net: $0 (BREAKEVEN monthly, cumulative: -$13,500)
```

**Months 5-12 (Profit Growth):**
```
Months 5-12: 2 new installs/month
             Each month revenue grows by +$2,250 (2 new units)
             
Month 12 Status:
- 24 units installed (all in Phase 1 at 75% share)
- Monthly revenue: $27,000 ($1,125 × 24)
- Monthly costs: $2,800 (overhead only, no new installs this month for clarity)
- Monthly profit: $24,200
- Cumulative profit (Months 5-12): +$42,500
```

**Year 2 (Scaling Residual Income as units transition to Phase 2):**
```
Month 18: First 6 units transition to Phase 2 (50% share)
          18 units @ $1,125 + 6 @ $750 = $24,750/month
          
Month 24: First 12 units at Phase 2, 12 still at Phase 1
          12 @ $1,125 + 12 @ $750 = $22,500/month
          Plus 24 NEW units installed in Year 2 = $49,500/month total
          Monthly overhead: $3,000
          Monthly profit: $46,500
```

**Scenario 2: Installation Model (for comparison)**
- 2 installs/month × $5,250 = $10,500 revenue - $2,000 costs = **$8,500 profit/month**  
- Consistent but NO residual income growth, NO recurring revenue
