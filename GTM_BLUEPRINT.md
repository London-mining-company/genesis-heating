# 🗺️ Go-To-Market (GTM) Blueprint
## Targeting: London, Ontario (Spring 2026)

### 1. Phase I: The "Neighbourhood Seed" (Months 1-3)
**Objective:** Establish 5 lighthouse installs in high-visibility London areas.
- **Priority Hubs:** Old North, Wortley Village, Byron.
- **Action:** Offer "Early Adopter" pricing (Ownership Path discount) to local community leaders or local business owners.
- **Signage:** "This Home Recycles 100% of its Computing Heat."

### 2. Phase II: The Neighbourhood Effect (Months 4-8)
**Objective:** Scale through concentrated local pools.
- **Geographic Focus:** Once 3 homes are signed in a single postal code, unlock a "Neighbourhood Pool Bonus" (additional 5% reward share for those homes).
- **Referral Loop:** "Refer a Neighbour" program. Referrer moves from Phase I to Phase II (50% share) 3 months faster.
- **Local Partnerships:** Partner with 1 high-end local HVAC company as the "Official Installation Partner."

### 3. Phase III: The "Subscription" Expansion (Months 9-12)
**Objective:** Transition to the Managed Service model as the primary growth engine.
- **Scaling:** Use the cash flow from Phase I "Ownership" sales to fund the hardware for "Managed" $(0$ down) units.
- **Commercial Outreach:** Target local laundromats, gyms, and hotels (high hot water usage).

### 4. Sales Script: The "Two Pathways" Pitch
**Opening:** "We're not here to sell you Bitcoin. We're here to help you recycle the heat you're already paying for."
- **Path 1 (Ownership):** "If you want the maximum return and priority install, you own the asset. We just manage the technical side for a small fee."
- **Path 2 (Managed):** "If you want zero risk and zero upfront, we'll install it, manage it, and you simply receive a growing credit on your utility bill."
