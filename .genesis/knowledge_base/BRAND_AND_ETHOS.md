# 05 - BRAND PHILOSOPHY & PERFORMANCE ETHOS
## The "Genesis" Identity

### A. The 14KB Performance Ethos
*   **Philosophy:** Speed is a brand value.
*   **Strategy:** The website must load in a single TCP round-trip. This signals technical competence. If our website is "over-engineered" for speed, our hardware is "over-engineered" for efficiency.
*   **Implementation:** Kernel v6 CSS, system font stacks, and zero-dependency Preact modules.

### B. The Premium Industrial Aesthetic
*   **Colors:** Cyber Black (`#000`), Safety Orange (`#ff5c00`).
*   **Typography:** High-weight, tightly kerned headings.
*   **Imagery:** Industrial cinematic (video-first).
*   **Tone:** Hardened, confident, and professional. We are not a "startup"; we are an "Infrastructure Partner."

### C. The "Job" to be Done
*   We don't solve "Hot Water."
*   We solve **"Economic Energy Friction."**
*   The customer isn't buying a tank; they are hiring a financial asset to manage their basement's thermal economy.
