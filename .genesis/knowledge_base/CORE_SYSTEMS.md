# 01 - MARKET INTELLIGENCE & POSITIONING
## Genesis Heating Solutions | London, Ontario Context

### A. The Geographic Target: London, ON
*   **Climate:** High thermal demand (~5-6 months of significant heating requirement).
*   **Energy Costs:** Ontario's tiered electricity pricing and gas fluctuations create a massive opening for "Thermally Resilient" hardware.
*   **Demographics:** Focusing on high-growth neighborhoods (Byron, Masonville, Wortley Village) where "Green Tech" meets "Economic Pragmatism."

### B. Competitive Strategy
*   **Legacy HVAC:** Reactive, hardware-focused, expense-based.
*   **Genesis:** Proactive, software-driven, asset-based.
*   **The "Why Now":** Energy independence is no longer a luxury; it is a financial necessity. We position the H1 as the "Tesla Powerwall" of thermal energy—it doesn't just sit there; it works.

# 02 - TECHNICAL BUNDLE & H1 SPECIFICATIONS
## Operational Core

### A. The Hardware (Superheat H1)
*   **Recovery Rate:** 24 gal/hour (industrial grade).
*   **Capture Efficiency:** ~98% of waste heat converted to usable thermal energy.
*   **Footprint:** Drop-in replacement for standard 50-60 gallon residential tanks.
*   **Connectivity:** LTE/WiFi integrated for real-time thermal monitoring and reward synchronization.

### B. HVAC Integration Standards
*   **Plumbing:** Standard NPT connections.
*   **Electrical:** Requires dedicated circuit (standard for electric or hybrid heaters).
*   **Venting:** Not required (closed-loop thermal capture), simplifying installation in tricky mechanical rooms.

# 03 - FINANCIAL ARCHITECTURE & REWARDS
## The "Pays You Back" System

### A. Reward Tiers
1.  **Level 1 (The Basic Credit):** Monthly CAD credit applied to the Genesis service fee or primary utility.
2.  **Level 2 (The Bitcoin Node):** Direct Lightning Network payouts based on validated uptime and thermal displacement.
3.  **Level 3 (Asset Ownership):** Full ownership model where the user captures 100% of the energy value after a 3-year ROI period.

### B. Carbon Offset Value
*   Every H1 unit offsets approximately **4.2 tons of CO2 annually**.
*   Future Roadmap: Tokenizing these offsets for high-value B2B tax credits.

# 04 - SALES FUNNEL & CUSTOMER JOURNEY
## Systematized Conversion

### Phase 1: Lead Scoring (The Website)
*   Input: Postal code + Monthly heating bill.
*   Score: High yield vs. low yield leads.

### Phase 2: The Digital Audit
*   Owner uses the "Genesis iPad App" (Visualizer) to show the ROI graph on the spot.
*   "No-Pressure" Close: Consultation focused on infrastructure upgrade, not "Sales."

### Phase 3: Hardware Validation
*   Contractor completes install -> Uploads thermal proof -> Triggers first reward cycle.
