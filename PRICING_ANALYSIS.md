## Revised Pricing Model (Analyst Recommendation)

### Path 1: "Own It Now" (REVISED)
**New Price:** $6,500 CAD (was $5,250)  
**Rationale:**
- Superheat H1 wholesale: $3,375 USD (~$4,550 CAD at 1.35 exchange)
- Professional HVAC install: $900-1,200 (licensed, insured, permits)
- Mining setup & pool config: $400-600 (technical expertise)
- **Total Cost:** ~$5,850-6,350
- **Margin:** $150-650 (2-10% gross margin)

**Revised Structure:**
- **Customer Pays:** $6,500 upfront
- **Customer Gets:** Hardware ownership + 90% of rewards (up from 85%)
- **Genesis Gets:** 10% ongoing service fee (down from 15%)
- **Gross Margin:** ~$650 (10%)
- **Ongoing Revenue:** ~$150/mo per unit (10% of $1,500/mo)

**Why This Works:**
- Still competitive vs. heat pump ($3,500) + no ongoing value
- Justifiable premium for compute capability
- Healthier margin for sustainability
- Higher customer share (90% vs 85%) = better value perception

---

### Path 2: "Grow Into Ownership" (REVISED)
**New Price:** $500 Service Activation (was $250)  
**Rationale:**
- $250 doesn't cover HVAC dispatch + admin
- Creates perception of "too cheap = low quality"
- $500 is psychological threshold (serious commitment, not impulse)

**Revised Timeline:**
- **Months 1-18:** Customer 30%, Genesis 70% (was 25%/75%)
- **Months 19-30:** Customer 60%, Genesis 40% (was 50%/50%)
- **Months 31-36:** Customer 85%, Genesis 15% (was 80%/20%)
- **Month 37+:** Hardware transfers + Customer 95%, Genesis 5%

**Why This Works:**
- Customer gets to 85% faster (Month 31 vs Month 37)
- Genesis recovers CAPEX in 18 months instead of 24
- $500 activation filters serious buyers
- Cleaner progression: 30% → 60% → 85% → 95%

## Risk Analysis: Pricing Sensitivity

### Scenario Testing

**If we price Path 1 at $6,500:**
- **Risk:** 20% of customers balk at price
- **Mitigation:** Path 2 exists as accessible alternative
- **Upside:** Higher margin protects against Bitcoin volatility
- **Net Effect:** Lose 3 customers/year, gain $18,750 in margin = **+$11,250 net**

**If we keep Path 1 at $5,250:**
- **Risk:** Unsustainable margins if HVAC labor costs rise
- **Risk:** Perceived as "cheap" vs heat pump market
- **Risk:** Can't weather Bitcoin price drops
- **Net Effect:** Race to bottom, reputation damage

**Analyst Verdict:** Price increase is lower risk than status quo.

### Genesis Perspective

**Path 1:**
