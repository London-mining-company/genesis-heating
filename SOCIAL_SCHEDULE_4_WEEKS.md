# 📅 4-Week Social Content Schedule: The "Genesis Narrative"

This schedule is designed to move Londoners from "What is this?" to "How do I get one?" using a drip-feed of clinical, high-trust content. 

**Ethos:** No hype. Just physics and local accountability.

## 🗓️ Week 1: The "Physics of Free" (Awareness)
*Goal: Introduce the 'One Watt, Two Purposes' logic. Don't mention Bitcoin yet. Focus on the waste.*

### **Post 1 (Monday): The Invisible Waste**
*   **Visual:** A close-up of a regular water heater in a dimly lit basement. (High contrast)
*   **Copy:** 
    Your current water heater is an energy dead-end. You pay for a watt of electricity, you get one watt of heat. That’s a 1:1 cost that never stops. 
    
    In Spring 2026, Londoners will start recycling electricity.
    
    We’re introducing hardware that uses every watt twice. Once for computation, and once for your shower. It’s not magic; it’s just better thermal management.

### **Post 2 (Thursday): The Official Hardware**
*   **Visual:** The Superheat H1 unit (Matte Black, glowing orange ring).
*   **Copy:** 
    "It fits exactly where your old tank is now." 
    
    The Superheat H1 isn't a prototype. It's industrial-grade hardware designed for 24/7 uptime. It fits standard plumbing footprints and delivers 24 gallons of recovery per hour. 
    
    Standard footprint. Superior economics.

## 🗓️ Week 2: The "Managed Service" (Trust)
*Goal: Show that Genesis handles the "scary tech" parts. Focus on the service.*

### **Post 3 (Monday): Local Expertise**
*   **Visual:** A professional HVAC technician (clean uniform) looking at a digital tablet.
*   **Copy:** 
    We aren't a tech company. We are a Licensed Ontario HVAC partner based right here in London.
    
    When you join the Genesis waitlist, you aren't buying a "gadget." You’re upgrading your infrastructure with a team that handles the installation, the 24/7 monitoring, and the maintenance.
    
    You enjoy the hot water; we manage the compute.

### **Post 4 (Thursday): The Data Bridge**
*   **Visual:** A clean, simplified infographic showing: [Electricity] -> [H1 Unit] -> [Heat & Calculation].
*   **Copy:** 
    "Will it affect my internet?" 
    
    No. Every Superheat H1 we install in London comes with its own dedicated connection. It never touches your home network or your personal data. 
    
    It performs mathematical computations that stay local to the hardware. Total privacy. Total efficiency.

## 🗓️ Week 3: The "Wait, it pays me?" (The Reveal)
*Goal: Address the rewards. Introduce the "Preferred Payout" choice.*

### **Post 5 (Monday): The Reward Narrative**
*   **Visual:** A hand holding a Canadian $100 bill OR a digital wallet screen (keep it clean/clinical).
*   **Copy:** 
    Why should your heat be a sunk cost when it could be an asset?
    
    Because the Superheat H1 performs high-value processing while it warms your water, it earns. We pass those rewards directly to you.
    
    Choose your path: A monthly CAD cheque to offset your bills, or direct Bitcoin deposit. Your home, your choice.

### **Post 6 (Thursday): The Neighbourhood Pool**
*   **Visual:** A map of London, ON with pins in Wortley Village, Old North, and Byron.
*   **Copy:** 
    Scale matters. 
    
    When we install a cluster of units in a single London neighbourhood, the efficiency of the local "pool" increases. 
    
    We are currently prioritizing installations in areas with the most signups. Is your street on the list yet?

## 🗓️ Week 4: The FOMO (Conversion)
*Goal: Drive urgency for the Spring 2026 rollout.*

### **Post 7 (Monday): $0 Down Strategy**
*   **Visual:** A "Waitlist" dashboard showing "Filling Fast."
*   **Copy:** 
    Low barrier. High return.
    
    We offer flexible entry points for London homeowners, including $0 upfront options. The goal is simple: Create immediate utility savings from day one.
    
    Upgrade your home's IQ without the upfront friction.
    #LdnOnt #ZeroDown #UtilityHedge

### **Post 8 (Thursday): The Deadline**
*   **Visual:** Cinematic shot of the H1 unit with the text "SPRING 2026."
*   **Copy:** 
    The first wave of London installs begins in 14 months.
    
    Once our Spring 2026 capacity is reached, we won't be accepting new consultations until the Fall. 
    
    Secure your spot in the queue. Join the waitlist today.

## 💡 Pro-Tips for Posting:
1.  **Engagement:** If someone asks "Is this Bitcoin?", reply: *"Yes, the H1 processes Bitcoin transactions to generate the heat your water needs. We recapture that energy so it's not wasted. It's the most efficient way to heat a home."*
2.  **Consistency:** Post on the same days/times each week (e.g., 10:00 AM EST).
3.  **Stories:** Share "Behind the Scenes" of the website or the London office to keep the "Local" feeling alive.
