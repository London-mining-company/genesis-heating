## 🚀 2. Campaign Pipeline: Vision Expansion
*These are the next "Chess Moves" once Phase 1 (Pilot Houses) is active.*

### **Campaign A: The "Hydro Bill Audit" (High Trust)**
*   **The Hook:** "Stop guessing. We'll audit your 2025 London Hydro bill and show you exactly where the waste is."
*   **The Angle:** Position the H1 as a financial instrument, not a heater.
*   **Requirement:** A simple PDF or landing page tool where they can upload their bill.

### **Campaign B: The "Wortley Village Walk-By"**
*   **The Hook:** QR codes on "Pilot House" lawn signs in high-traffic London areas.
*   **The Angle:** Physical social proof. "This house is recycling heat. Are you?"
*   **Requirement:** Branded lawn signs with "Live Earnings" displayed (e.g., "This home earned $112 last month").

## 💡 3. Battle-Tested Insights (The Playbook)

### **Insight 1: The "Local HVAC" Halo Effect**
**The Lesson:** In Ontario, people fear "Fly-by-night" water heater scams. 
**The Action:** Every ad and post must mention **"Professional Installation by Licensed Ontario HVAC Partners."** Use the color orange (trust/warmth) and blue (professionalism). Avoid high-contrast "neon" crypto colors.

### **Insight 2: The "Overnight (ULO) Arbitrage"**
**The Lesson:** Londoners understand "Peak Hours." 
**The Action:** Focus lead-gen copy on **"Charging at 2.8¢, Paying out at 100%."** Frame the H1 as a tool that lets them win against the utility company.

### **Insight 3: The "Silent & Sleek" Visual**
**The Lesson:** Resistance often comes from spouses worried about "noise and industrial junk" in the basement.
**The Action:** Show the H1 in a clean laundry room or finished basement. Emphasize **"Liquid Cooled & Silent."**

## 📅 6. The "Grandmaster" 30-Day Turnkey Campaign
**Theme:** *The London Utility Hedge* | **Frequency:** 3 Posts / 3 Days | **Platform:** Meta (FB/IG) + Local Groups

### **Phase I: The Perception Shift (Days 1-10)**
*Focus: Redefining the mechanical room from a "Expense" to an "Asset."*

*   **Day 1 (Awareness): The Asset Intro**
    *   **Creative:** [h1_mechanical_room_sleek]
    *   **Headline:** Stop paying for hot water. Let your hot water pay you.

    *   **CTA:** Learn the Math [Link]

*   **Day 7 (Trust): Local & Licensed**
    *   **Creative:** Close-up of the H1 highlighting "Professional Installation"

    *   **Creative:** Photo of a rusted old tank vs. the H1
