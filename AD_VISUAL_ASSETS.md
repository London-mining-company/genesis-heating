# 🖼️ Visual Ad Assets: The "Genesis Clinical" Creative (Ad #1)

Since we are prioritizing a viral, non-pompous, and official look, the visual creative must do 80% of the work without a single word of text on the image itself.

---

## 📸 Asset A: The "Hardware Hero" (Main Ad Image)
*This is the PRIMARY visual for the 'Clinical' ad.*

**The Concept:** A "Jobs-era" product shot. We want the user to look at it and think: *"What is that and why does it look so much better than my current water heater?"*

**Visual Composition:**
- **The Unit:** A single Superheat H1 (Matte Black, minimalist cylinder).
- **The Light:** Only one glowing element—the thin vertical orange status ring.
- **The Setting:** A modern mechanical room. Clean copper pipes, dark grey walls, cinematic "mood" lighting. 
- **The Angle:** Slightly from below (Hero angle) to make the hardware look monumental and official.

**Why it works:** It looks like "Official Hardware." It doesn't look like a startup project; it looks like infrastructure.

## 🎨 Asset B: The "Infographic Overlay" (For Week 2 & 3)
*Use this as a secondary slide or a carousel card to explain the value.*

**Visual Composition:**
- **Background:** The same dark mechanical room, but blurred.
- **Top Center Text:** "One Watt. Two Purposes." (White, Helvetica/Inter Bold)
- **Central Graphic:** A minimalist icon-based flow: 
    - [⚡ Standard Power] ➔ [🔥 100% Heat Capture] ➔ [💰 Monthly Rewards]
- **Bottom Text:** "Spring 2026. London, ON."
