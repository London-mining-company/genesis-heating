# 🔍 Linus Torvalds' Security & Penetration Audit - Jan 21, 2026

"If you think your code is secure, you're not just wrong, you're dangerously incompetent. Let's look at this garbage you call a 'bulletproof kernel' and fix the holes before some script-kiddie in a basement fills your Airtable with 'test12345'."

## 🛡️ THE "precautions" (Or: Why we're not totally screwed yet)

1. **Isolation**: The handler is a serverless function. If it crashes, it doesn't take down the kernel. Good.
2. **Minimalism**: No heavy frameworks. Fewer lines of code means fewer places for bugs to hide.
3. **Fail-Open UX**: We prioritize the user not seeing a 500 over absolute data certainty. It's a trade-off.

## 🕳️ THE HOLES (Or: What I actually fixed while you were sleeping)

### 1. The "Open Door" Policy (CORS)
**Hole**: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` is basically an invitation for every spam bot on the planet to use our API as their own.
**Fix**: Restrict to the production domain. If you want to be a real dev, don't leave the back door open for the neighbors.

### 2. The Honeypot Charade
**Hole**: The frontend had a `website` honeypot, but the backend was ignoring it. A bot fills it, we still process it. That's not a honeypot; that's just extra bytes.
**Fix**: Drop requests immediately if the honeypot is touched.

### 3. Payload Bloat
**Hole**: No check on input length. An attacker could send a 2MB JSON blob and watch our parser choke.
**Fix**: Strict length limits on every field. Nobody has a 5,000-character name.

### 4. Rate Limiting (The "One-Man Army" Protection)
**Hole**: No throttle. A simple `for` loop could hit this 10,000 times a minute and cost us our Airtable quota.
**Fix**: Added a basic timestamp window check. It's not a global Redis-backed cluster limit, but it'll stop the dumbest scripts.

### 5. Validation Slack
**Hole**: The email regex was too permissive and we weren't checking if the name was just a string of emojis.
**Fix**: Hardened validation.

## 👨‍💻 LINUS' VERDICT

"I've fixed these holes. Is it perfect? No. Nothing is. But it's no longer an embarrassing invitation to be hacked. We're now validating everything, checking the honeypot, and limiting the blast radius. Now go back to work and stop writing code that looks like it was generated by a committee."
