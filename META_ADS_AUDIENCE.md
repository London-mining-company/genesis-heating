# 🎯 META ADS: PRECISION AUDIENCE ARCHITECTURE
## [Genesis Heating Solutions | London, ON - Pilot Campaign]

This audience is designed to find the "Genetic Match" for Genesis: homeowners who understand technology and are frustrated by rising utility costs. We are building for **high-conversion, high-trust intent.**

---

### 📍 1. Geographic Core
*   **Primary Location:** London, Ontario
*   **Radius:** +40 km (25 miles)
*   **Included Hubs:** St. Thomas, Strathroy, Ingersoll, Woodstock, Lucan.
*   **Rationale:** We need density for the "Forrest Pool" cluster strategy. Clusters reduced travel time for our HVAC partners.

---

### 👤 2. Demographic Profile
*   **Age:** 30 – 55. 
    *   *Why:* This is the peak "Homeowner & Bill-Payer" bracket. Younger (30s) are tech-first; older (50s) are savings-first.
*   **Gender:** All.
*   **Household Income:** Top 25% (if available via proxy).
*   **Homeownership Status:** Homeowners (Estimated).

### 🧬 3. Detailed Targeting (The "Dual-Intent" Layering)
*To be "Deep and Precise," we use **AND** logic (Narrow Audience) rather than **OR** logic.*

#### **Layer 1: The Foundation (Home & Infrastructure)**
*Must match AT LEAST ONE of these:*
*   **Interests:** Home improvement, Renovation, Smart home, HVAC, Energy conservation, Solar energy, Net-zero, Sustainability.
*   **Behaviors:** Resident of London, ON (Frequent Travelers / Settled).

#### **AND Layer 2: The Catalyst (Technology & Investing)**
*Must ALSO match AT LEAST ONE of these:*
*   **Interests:** Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency, Blockchain, Decentralized finance (DeFi), Investing, NVIDIA, Cloud computing, Edge computing, High-performance computing.
*   **Rationale:** We don't want "just" HVAC people; we want people who understand that compute has value. This reduces the "educational burden" of the ad.

### 🧪 4. Three Split-Test Ad Sets
*Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Run these 3 variations with $10/day each.*

1.  **The "Crypto High-IQ" Set:** Focus on "Heat Arbitrage" and "ULO Rates." Target Crypto interests heavily + Homeowners.
2.  **The "Sustainability" Set:** Focus on "Net Zero" and "3.8 tons CO2 reduction." Target Solar/Green energy interests + Homeowners.
3.  **The "Stressed Homeowner" Set:** Focus on "Hydro Bill Audit" and "Beat the Utility." Target Home Improvement/Reno interests only.

### 🧭 5. Troubleshooting the Admin Dashboard
If you cannot see the Admin Dashboard at `genesisheatingsolutions.ca/?admin=Zomaya-Genesis-2026-Secure`, check these 3 things:

1.  **Direct URL Access:** You MUST type the `?` exactly. The easiest way is to copy-paste this whole link: 
    *   `https://genesisheatingsolutions.ca/?admin=Zomaya-Genesis-2026-Secure`
2.  **Incognito Mode:** If your browser has cached a previous session, try opening the link in an **Incognito / Private Window**. This forces the site to check the URL parameters from scratch.
3.  **Vercel Deployment Status:** If the site is still "Building" or on an old version, the code changes for the dashboard might not be live yet. Check your Vercel dashboard to ensure the latest commit is "Ready."
