# Genesis Heating Solutions: Realistic Market Projection
## London, Ontario - Success Estimation (2026-2028)

---

## Market Reality

### London Demographics
- **Total Metro Population:** 422,000
- **Total Households:** ~165,000
- **Electric Water Heater Homes:** ~45,000 (27%)
- **Our Ideal Customer Profile:** 5,000-8,000 homes

### Conservative Penetration Model
- **Year 1 Target:** 0.6% market penetration = 30 installs
- **Year 2 Target:** 1.2% market penetration = 60 total installs
- **Year 3 Target:** 2.0% market penetration = 100 total installs

**Why Conservative?**
- New technology requires education
- Superheat H1 is CES 2026 launch = zero local brand awareness
- HVAC upgrades are considered purchases (long sales cycle)
- We're a one-person operation with limited bandwidth

## The Chess Grandmaster's Assessment

### Strengths (What We Control)
✅ **Dual Revenue Model:** Package A funds Package B CAPEX  
✅ **Recurring Income:** Scales to passive by Year 3  
✅ **Local Moat:** First-mover in London for Superheat  
✅ **Asset Ownership:** We own 60% of the hardware (Package B units)  
✅ **Low Overhead:** Solo operation with contracted labor  

### Risks (External Factors)
⚠️ **Bitcoin Price Volatility:** Rewards fluctuate with market  
⚠️ **Compute Demand:** If mining becomes unprofitable, credits drop  
⚠️ **Superheat Delivery:** Dependent on their production timeline  
⚠️ **Regulatory:** Ontario could change electrical codes  
⚠️ **Competition:** Other installers could copy the model  

### Mitigations
1. **Conservative Estimates:** We underpromise, so fluctuations don't hurt reputation
2. **Hardware First:** System is a functional water heater regardless of compute value
3. **Exclusivity:** Establish as "Authorized Genesis Partner" for Superheat in London
4. **Fast Iteration:** Track metrics weekly, adjust pitch based on what converts
5. **Reputation Obsession:** One bad install kills referrals. Quality > speed.

2. To install only when it genuinely benefits the customer
3. To respond to service calls within 48 hours
4. To be transparent about what we earn vs what they receive
5. To prioritize reputation over short-term profit

**We Refuse:**
