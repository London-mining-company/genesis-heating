# 🚀 Facebook Ad Strategy: "Thermal Recycling" Launch

## 🎨 Art Direction (The "Official" Superheat Look)
Since the `generate_image` tool is currently at capacity, use the following prompt in Midjourney or DALL-E 3 to get the exact "Jobs-era" aesthetic:
> **Prompt:** A premium, official product advertisement shot for the Superheat H1. The unit is a sleek, matte black minimalist cylinder with a thin, vertical glowing orange status light. It is installed in a modern, clean mechanical room with high-end industrial pipes. The lighting is cinematic, high-contrast, with a "dark mode" aesthetic. No text on the product. 8k, photographic, professional product photography.

One watt. Two purposes. 

✅ Same hot water performance.  
✅ Monthly computational rewards.

Our goal isn't to sell you Bitcoin. It's to help you recycle the energy you’re already paying for.

## 📝 Ad Copy Option 2: The "Wait, What?" Hook (Viral potential)
*Designed to trigger comments/shares.*

**Headline:** Why are Londoners recycling heat?

**Post Text:**
There’s a new type of appliance arriving in London, Ontario this Spring.

It looks like professional hardware. It heats your water. But it’s also a data center. 🏢

By capturing the "exhaust" heat from high-value processing, the Superheat H1 effectively offsets your utility bill. You get the heat for free because the data needs it gone. 

High-efficiency thermal management meets the digital economy. 

Check if your neighbourhood is eligible for the Phase I rollout.

## ⚙️ Facebook Algo Best Practices Implemented:
1. **The 3-Second Rule:** The headline "Your water heater shouldn't be a bill" targets a universal pain point immediately.
2. **Local Relevance:** Explicitly mentions London, ON and Spring 2026 to increase local click-through rates.
3. **Low Barrier to Entry:** Emphasizes "Zero technical knowledge" to avoid the common "it's too complicated" Bitcoin filter.
4. **Value-First:** Focuses on the "One Watt, Two Purposes" logic which is hard to argue with.
