# Genesis Heating Solutions: Fair Partnership Model
## Win-Win by Design

---

## The Core Principle

**By Year 3, the customer owns 80%+ of the rewards AND the hardware.**

This isn't a rental scheme. It's a partnership where Genesis helps you acquire an asset, then gradually transfers ownership and value to you as we recoup our investment fairly.

---

## The Two Pathways

### Path 1: Own It Now
**Upfront:** $5,250  
**You Get:** The hardware is yours immediately. 85% of all rewards from day one.  
**Genesis Gets:** 15% ongoing service fee for pool management and support.  
**Best For:** Those who can invest upfront and want maximum immediate value.

### Path 2: Grow Into Ownership
**Upfront:** $250 activation fee  
**The Journey:**
- **Months 1-12:** You receive 25%, we receive 75% (we're recovering the hardware cost)
- **Months 13-24:** You receive 50%, we receive 50% (balanced partnership)
- **Months 25-36:** You receive 80%, we receive 20% (you're nearly there)
- **Month 37+:** Hardware ownership transfers to you. You receive 95%, we receive 5% (minimal service fee)

**Best For:** Zero capital outlay. You end up owning the asset without ever paying for it upfront.

---

## Why This Is Fair

### For You (The Customer):
- **Path 1:** You own it immediately, keep 85% forever
- **Path 2:** You own it by Year 3, and your share grows every year until you're receiving 95%

### For Genesis:
- **Path 1:** We earn a fair service fee (15%) for managing the technical complexity
- **Path 2:** We recover our $4,500 investment over 24 months, then transition to minimal service fee

### The Math (Path 2 Example):
**Genesis Investment:** $4,500 (hardware + install)  
**Genesis Recovery (Months 1-24):** ~$18,000 (at 75%/50% share)  
**Genesis Profit (Fair):** ~$13,500 over 2 years  
**Customer Cost:** $250 activation  
**Customer Receives (Year 3+):** 95% of all output + hardware ownership

**Both parties win. The customer gets an asset. Genesis gets fair compensation for the risk and service.**

---

## Hardware Ownership Transfer (Path 2)

**Month 36:** We execute a formal ownership transfer:
- Hardware title transfers to customer
- Customer now owns the Superheat H1 outright
- Genesis retains 5% service fee for ongoing pool management (optional - customer can self-manage if desired)
- Customer can sell, upgrade, or continue operating the unit

**This is not a lease. This is a path to ownership.**

---

## The Win-Win Guarantee

**We Promise:**
1. Clear timelines for ownership transfer
2. No hidden fees or extensions
3. By Year 3, you own the hardware (Path 2) or you already owned it (Path 1)
4. Your share of rewards always increases, never decreases
5. We earn fairly for the service we provide, then step back

**You Get:**
1. A functional water heater (regardless of compute value)
2. Utility offsets that grow over time
3. Eventual hardware ownership
4. Professional management with no technical burden
5. A partner who wants you to succeed

## Why We Do It This Way

**Traditional HVAC:** You pay $1,200 for a standard tank. You get hot water. That's it.

**Genesis Model:** You pay $250 (or $5,250 to own immediately). You get:
- Hot water (same as traditional)
- Growing utility credits
- Path to hardware ownership
- Professional management
- A partner invested in your success

**We don't want to own your water heater forever. We want to help you acquire an asset that serves you for a decade.**

---

## The Ethical Foundation

This model works because:
1. **Transparency:** You know exactly when ownership transfers
2. **Fairness:** We recover our costs fairly, then transfer value to you
3. **Alignment:** We succeed when you succeed
4. **Sustainability:** We build a reputation, not a rental empire
5. **Long-term:** We want you as an advocate, not a captive customer

**By Year 3, you're not our customer anymore. You're our success story.**
